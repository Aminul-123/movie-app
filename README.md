- passing props to other component.
- destructuring
- deleting from list
- Adding more to the list
-  making total statistics

- useState
- searching some results from api.

Practice

next ->
- detail page : when user clicks the poster of the movie , it will then go to detail page
        where - there will be  all the detail of a single movie, including a add to watchlist button,  
- watchList page : for this use react-router dom , 
    Here there will be all the movie which we added to watchList ,
     at the top there will be statistics of  it - avg rating,
     total no. of movie added to watchlist,
- next -> beautify watchListPage and add loading effect
        -delete movie from watchList - done 

next -> if a movie is selected once , it cant be added to watchList again - will be implementing this features . doing these will end today's implementation. - done

next -> statistics of the result.
